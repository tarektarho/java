# Lecture two

# Covered in class:

## Homework:
  * Update your CV:
    1. Remove sensitive personal information. You can link to your LinkedIn account for instance if you want people to be able to reach you
    2. Look at the feedback from the last module (HTML/CSS) change your CV to reflect this feedback.
    3. Validate your html using the W3c Vaidator https://validator.w3.org/
  * Complete the following codecamp assignments:
    * Start at https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/write-reusable-javascript-with-functions
    * And make the next couple assignments until your reach: Assignment with a Returned Value
  * Add a useful function to your website:<br>
    Write a js feature that follows the following rules
     1. It takes user input on a website (look up input fields)
     2. It uses that input as parameters for a function
     3. The function does something with the parameters and returns a value using 'return'
     4. The return value is used on the website.
    * For instance: Create a function that allows people to input a certain product they eat or drink every day and then asks how long they expect to live (for instance someone smokes one pack of cigarettes a day and expects to live 25 more years) then they might spend 1 X priceOfPack x 365 x lifeExpectancy euros on that product
    * Be creative. If your idea is too complex to finish, don't worry, this exercise is really about trying to write some code yourself and applying what you've learnt.
  * Try to solve Unmesh' challenge:
      Assignment for “for loops” :
      * Print ’n’ lines of a Pascal’s triangle.
  * Hand in your homework in Trello
